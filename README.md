Problem
-------

"I want to worship at the temple. Can I get an appointment?" Pull up the [Temple Scheduler app](https://tosr.churchofjesuschrist.org/) and choose your temple. Let's say Provo City Center temple. "Are there appointments here?" Click 4 or 7 buttons to pick your chosen proxy ordinance, group count, and eventually date. Nope, the calendar is full. Let's switch to the Orem temple. Another 4 to 7 clicks, and that temple is full that day too. How about Mt. Timpanogos? Yep, full too. Draper? Payson? Jordan River? A half hour later I'm exhausted, and I still haven't found a spot. "Can I just search across temples for available appointments?"

Solution
